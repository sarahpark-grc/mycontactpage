        <h1>About</h1>
        <h2>Well hello there.</h2>
        <p>Everyday, I make an addition to my Fish Wall.</p>
        <p>“What do you mean by &lsquo;Fish Wall?&rsquo;” I&lsquo;m so glad you asked! Since my first week of college, I have been compiling drawings of fish—betta fish, flying fish, Stevie Wonder fish, Ken from the Barbie movie fish—and sticking them to my wardrobe, now dubbed the “Fish Wall.” It is an outlet for silly ideas that I can laugh at. Outlandish ideas that inspire my work for projects. Ambitious ideas that challenge my technique. But most of all, the Fish Wall is a representation of my drive.</p>
        <p>Artistry is my passion and fish are my muse, but what I love most about my Fish Wall is how it pushes me toward learning new skills. One of my first forays into animation was of a fish. Currently, I am learning Adobe Illustrator and Adobe Photoshop, with several of my projects including compositions of fish. As the Fish Wall develops and evolves, so too will I evolve, in both skillset and imagination.</p>
        <p>millions of unique ideas pop into my brain; if I can expand this much upon only one subject, then the possibilities for other subjects are endless! I&rsquo;d love to submerge myself in a pool of bottomless ideas with you!</p>
        <p>p.s. You should check out that fine fellow Frederick to the right. I hear he's really good at dancing!</p>
